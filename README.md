I created the project using the SpecFlow framework, which supports BDD.
It consists of two projects: Pages and Tests.
Pages provides a base class, its subclass, and a model that corresponds to the model creator and test data reader. The base abstract class initialize the driver, explicit wait and requires subclasses to implement a method for opening the login page. Its subclass additionally implements properties of all necessary web elements of the page and defines all the actions that can be performed.
Tests project further provides driver, feature, step definitions and hooks. The driver uses the Singleton pattern to configure the WebDriver and provides various driver configurations back to the caller. The feature file defines testing steps according to Gherkin rules and sets up step definitions, which call methods from the page objects and provide step logging information. Hooks initialize the container to register the driver instance and the scenario context. The hooks binding file, in addition, defines methods to initialize the Serilog object, log errors and information, and take screenshots if an error occurs after each scenario.
